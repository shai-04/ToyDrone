            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                This game was developed by Shaiyur Dooken for a technical assessment assigned by 
                <a href="https://www.gamesglobal.com/">Games Global</a>. This game was developed 
                using HTML5, CSS3 and JS (vanilla, no frameworks here!). This assessment required 
                the candidate to create a 10x10 grid which allows a toy drone / tank to be placed 
                on. Once the drone is placed on the grid, the player can then have access to the 
                following functions:
                <ul>
                    <li>Movement</li>
                    <li>Rotation</li>
                    <li>Firing a missile</li>
                    <li>Report status</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h1>Placement</h1>
            <p>
                Before you can access any other function of the drone, it has to be placed on the grid first. To do so, 
                simply tap or click the cell you'd like the drone to be placed in. Cells can be identified by the white border 
                around it. Hovering over the cell will also cause it to be highlighted for easy identification.
            </p>

            <h1>Movement</h1>
            <p>
                Press the <span class = "key">X</span> key on your keyboard to advance the drone 1 cell in the direction 
                that it is currently facing. For mobile players, press the <span class="key"><i class="fa-solid fa-person-walking"></i></span> 
                button on-screen.
            </p>

            <h1>Rotation</h1>
            <p>
                Press the <span class = "key">&lArr;</span> key on your keyboard to rotate the drone 90 degrees to the left. 
                Press the <span class = "key">&rArr;</span> key on your keyboard to rotate the drone 90 degrees to the right. 
                Alternatively, for mobile players, press the <span class="key"><i class="fa-solid fa-angles-left"></i></span> 
                or <span class="key"><i class="fa-solid fa-angles-right"></i></span> button on-screen to rotate 90 degrees to the 
                left or right respectively. The direction can also be viewed on the dashboard compass.
            </p>

            <h1>Firing a missile</h1>
            <p>
                Press the <span class="key">Z</span> key on your keyboard to launch a missile 2 cells ahead of the current direction 
                that you're facing. Alternatively, press the <span class="key"><i class="fa-solid fa-gun"></i></span> button on-screen.
            </p>

            <h1>Report status</h1>
            <p>
                To view the current position and direction of the drone, press the <span class="key">C</span> key on your keyboard, or 
                the <span class="key"><i class="fa-solid fa-note-sticky"></i></span> on-screen. The status will be displayed on the dashboard.
